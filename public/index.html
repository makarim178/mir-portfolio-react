    I am a Full-stack Developer, and currently pursuing Diploma in Enterprise Web & Mobile Application Development. After spending and working at the 3D Architectural industry, as well as a project manager at my home country for many years, I had an opportunity to migrate to Canada. As a new commer in Canada, I had a chance to reshuffle my career, I had no other thoughts than upgrading my skills in Enterprise web and mobile application development. Therefore, I chose to study Enterprise web and mobile application development at Trios College. One of my greatest passion is to enhance my knowledge on new technologies to help building interesting applications to better serve users. I've been fortunate to work on two large Enterprise Resource planning solutions. Thus, my life's greatest achievment was appreciated as one of the greatest innovations to develop insurance industry digitally by the Government of Bangladesh. While being a student at Trios College, I nurtured my skills in many ways, learning many stacks, skills, and languages to build e-commerce and progressive applications." />
